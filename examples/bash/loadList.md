## What's a list?
When using Elastic Email, you send emails to contacts â€“ recipients who receive your emails. Contacts can be grouped by created segments or lists. Segments add contacts automatically when specfied conditions are met, and contacts on lists are managed manually.

## Preparation
It's a Bash script so it's a program to be run by Unix shell. On linux (eg. Ubuntu) there's no need to install anything additional. 

Create a new file eg. `script.sh`

Download the lib from ElasticEmail repository https://github.com/ElasticEmail/elasticemail-bash and make sure the script has executable rights
```
$ chmod u+x ElasticEmail
```

## Let's dig into the code

Put the below code to your file.

In the first line indicate that it's a bash script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
```

Variable for host value:

```bash
host=https://api.elasticemail.com
```

Use your API key (remember to check a required access level):

```bash
apiKey=YOUR_API_KEY
```

and create header variables for api key:
```bash
apiKeyHeaderName=X-ElasticEmail-ApiKey
apiKeyHeader=$apiKeyHeaderName:$apiKey
```

Define a method that will be used:
```
apiMethod=listsByNameGet
```

The only thing you need to specify is a list name

```bash
listName="test name 3[]??[]Special_characters!@#$%^&*()222"
```

But in case when your name contains some special URL characters you need to properly encode it first. For example you can use Bash engine and `encodeURIComponent` from JavaScript language for doing that or use other way of your preference:

```bash
listNameEncoded=$(node -p "encodeURIComponent('$listName')") # output: "%5B%5D%3F%3F%5B%5DSpecial_characters%21%40%23%24%25%5E%26%2A%28%29222%0A"
```

And finally, you can use the lib to make an api call:

```bash
./ElasticEmail --host $host $apiMethod name="$listNameEncoded" $apiKeyHeader
```

## The whole code to copy and paste:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

host=https://api.elasticemail.com

apiKey=YOUR_API_KEY

apiKeyHeaderName=X-ElasticEmail-ApiKey
apiKeyHeader=$apiKeyHeaderName:$apiKey

apiMethod=listsByNameGet

listName="test name 3[]??[]Special_characters!@#$%^&*()222"

listNameEncoded=$(node -p "encodeURIComponent('$listName')") # output: "%5B%5D%3F%3F%5B%5DSpecial_characters%21%40%23%24%25%5E%26%2A%28%29222%0A"

./ElasticEmail --host $host $apiMethod name="$listNameEncoded" $apiKeyHeader
```

## Run the code
```
bash script.sh
```
