# Add List

This guide will walk you through the process of adding a new list of contacts to your account using the Bash library. 

*Required Access Level: ModifyContacts*

## What's a list?
When using Elastic Email, you send emails to contacts â€“ recipients who receive your emails. Contacts can be grouped by created segments or lists. Segments add contacts automatically when specfied conditions are met, and contacts on lists are managed manually.

## Preparation
It's a Bash script so it's a program to be run by Unix shell. On linux (eg. Ubuntu) there's no need to install anything additional. 

Create a new file eg. `script.sh`

Download the lib from ElasticEmail repository https://github.com/ElasticEmail/elasticemail-bash and make sure the script has executable rights
```
$ chmod u+x ElasticEmail
```

## Let's dig into the code

Put the below code to your file.

In the first line indicate that it's a bash script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
```

Variable for host value:

```bash
host=https://api.elasticemail.com
```

Use your API key (remember to check a required access level):

```bash
apiKey=YOUR_API_KEY
```

and create header variables for api key:
```bash
apiKeyHeaderName=X-ElasticEmail-ApiKey
apiKeyHeader=$apiKeyHeaderName:$apiKey
```

Define a method that will be used:
```
apiMethod=listsPost
```

Create a JSON object with details about new list. Only `ListName` is required. 

You can also define if to allow unsubscription from list and pass an emails array of existing contacts on your account to add them to list during list creation. 


```bash
json='{
        ListName: "Best contacts",
        AllowUnsubscribe: true,
        Emails: ["johnsmith@domain.com"]
    }'
```


And finally, you can use the lib to make an api call:

```bash
echo $json | ./ElasticEmail --host $host --content-type json $apiMethod - $apiKeyHeader
```

## The whole code to copy and paste:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

host=https://api.elasticemail.com

apiKey=YOUR_API_KEY

apiKeyHeaderName=X-ElasticEmail-ApiKey
apiKeyHeader=$apiKeyHeaderName:$apiKey

apiMethod=listsPost

json='{
    ListName: "Best contacts",
    AllowUnsubscribe: true,
    Emails: ["johnsmith@domain.com"]
}'

echo $json | ./ElasticEmail --host $host --content-type json $apiMethod - $apiKeyHeader
```

## Run the code
```
bash script.sh
```
